This file consist the verilog code of Asynchronous FIFO
first we have written the code of synchronous FIFO and then we made asynchronous FIFO
Implemented 16 Ã— 8 Asynchronous FIFO in verilog to avoid metastability issues in Clock Domain Crossing
Designed two Flip-Flop Synchronizer and gray code counter addressing to avoid skewed sampling of multi-bit value
All the codes are in the file
